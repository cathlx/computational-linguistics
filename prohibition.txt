America is the land of Liberty.  You can think what you want to think, and you can say what you  want to say; 
but you cannot always do what you want to do —  without breaking the law.
Today you cannot use hard drugs, because it is against the law. The law has decided that drugs are dangerous,  
and most people believe that the law is right. Today, in many places, you cannot smoke a cigarette in the street. 
But today, you can sit in a  bar and drink a beer — just as long as you are not below the age limit;  
a hundred years ago, you could not. America was dry. Alcohol was  illegal. You could neither drink it nor make it, 
nor buy it, nor import it, nor sell it.
